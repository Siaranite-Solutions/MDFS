# Siaranite Disk File System (SDFS)

Siaranite Disk File System (referred to SDFS from here on) is a filesystem implementation and specification written in C#, 
primarily used in Cosmos operating systems.

The specification and other documentation can be found in the /docs/ folder, 
and any implementation source code can be found in the /source/ folder. 

It is recommended that you read the specification and other documentation before implementing this filesystem in your Operating System.
